The St Johnâ€™s Touch Football League site is a modern and beautiful website built from scratch to manage league stats, standings, schedule and news. I handled all web design and backend development, as well as all branding and logo design.

The website features a custom python CMS on the backend, and custom instagram slider plugin for managing home page videos.

Technologies used include python, postgresql, nginx, and vuejs.
