This website was developed as a brochure website for a desktop app targeted at structural engineers. The website is a static site hosted for free using Netlify.

I also developed the app itself, which is an Electron app written as a vue single page app. Featured technologies include Vuejs, vuex, webpack, babel, and firebase.
